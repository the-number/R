   4. (Com.) The process of setting accounts or debts between
      parties residing at a distance from each other, without
      the intervention of money, by exchanging orders or drafts,
      called bills of exchange. These may be drawn in one
      country and payable in another, in which case they are
      called foreign bills; or they may be drawn and made
      payable in the same country, in which case they are called
      inland bills. The term bill of exchange is often
      abbreviated into exchange; as, to buy or sell exchange.
      [1913 Webster]

         from B in New York. C transmits the bill to D in New
         York, who receives the amount from B.

   {Par of exchange}, the established value of the coin or
      standard of value of one country when expressed in the
      coin or standard of another, as the value of the pound
      sterling in the currency of France or the United States.
      The par of exchange rarely varies, and serves as a measure
      for the rise and fall of exchange that is affected by the
      demand and supply. Exchange is at par when, for example, a
      bill in New York, for the payment of one hundred pounds
      sterling in London, can be purchased for the sum. Exchange
      is in favor of a place when it can be purchased there at
      or above par.
