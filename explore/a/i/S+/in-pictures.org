* In Pictures
  The group S that is generated from {RRll, UUdd, FFbb}

  About how we do these pictures on this Guix machine.
  [[https://github.com/emersion/grim]] is a tool that worked
  for the screen captures that you see below.

  How to select the region to capture?
  [[https://github.com/emersion/slurp]], slurp -p, then click
  inside the region to capture gives details that may
  be conveyed to 'grim.'
** The S+ group
  Our first sub-challenge is to look at centre-cubelets.
  The upper suffices we consider here are:
  ^c the corners, ^e for edges, and ^+ are centres.
  The permuter S_F^+=(FFbb)^+ is of order 1.
** The standard permutation
