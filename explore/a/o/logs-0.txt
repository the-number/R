    Rubik: a: explore/a
    
    Reading: The Mathematics of the Rubik
    http://web.mit.edu/sp.268/www/rubik.pdf
    
    Page 4: (a^{-1})^{-1}=a
       Here, for our convenience, we write -a for the inverse of a.
       The inverse of the inverse of a is again a (not the neutral
       element, the identity e), keeping in mind the basic
       group theorems. We write -(-A)=A, for example.
    
    Page 4: Group theory gives the inverse element of A to be
       -A, such that A*-A=0.
       Here, we write O instead of e for the neutral element,
       that is the permutation that does nothing.
    
       Given the inverse -A with A*-A=0, it follows for A=(ab),
       that -(ab)=-b*-a, in our case because Rubik is a
       non-commutative, or non-abelian group. (-b*-a <> -a*-b)
    
    Following from the earlier example which proved that the
    Rubik group's F element, a clockwise 90 degree rotation
    of the front face, is the permutation as intended.
    
    The earlier example
    
    (FU FUR FR FDR FD FDL FL FUL FC)*F=
        (FU FUR FR FDR FD FDL FL FUL FC)*
         (FUR FDR)(FUR FDL)(FUR FUL)*(FU FR)(FU FD)(FU FL)=
        (FR FDR FD FDL FL FUL FU FUR FC)  which agrees, with the
                                          visual perception
    
    Now, confirm our understanding that F is a permutation of
    order four.  To proof this we apply F four times
    and expect to arrive at the initial configuration of the cube.
    
    (FU FUR FR FDR FD FDL FL FUL FC)*F*F*F*F=
    (FU FUR FR FDR FD FDL FL FUL FC).
    
    1. (FU FUR FR FDR FD FDL FL FUL FC)*
         (FUR FDR)(FUR FDL)(FUR FUL)*(FU FR)(FU FD)(FU FL)=
        (FR FDR FD FDL FL FUL FU FUR FC)
    2. (FR FDR FD FDL FL FUL FU FUR FC)*
         (FUR FDR)(FUR FDL)(FUR FUL)*(FU FR)(FU FD)(FU FL)=
        (FD FDL FL FUL FU FUR FL FDR FC)

    Notes on the Rubik group:
    
    Permutations
    
    Given the permutation
    (1 2 3 4 5)
    (5 1 3 2 4), for example.
    
    In terms of cycles this is
    (1 5 4 2)(3)  one 4-cycle, and a 1-cycle
    = (1 5 4 2)   eliding the redundant (3)
    
    Proof: 1->5 5->4 4->2 2->1 and 3 remains
    which gives
    (1 2 3 4 5)*(1 5 4 2)=
    (5 1 3 2 4) which agrees as given
    
    Also, the permutation
    (1 5 4 2) = (5 4 2 1)
    
    Proof:
    (1 2 3 4 5) * (5 4 2 1)=
    (5 1 3 2 4), which agrees with our example.
    
    And reducing the 4-cycle to three 2-cycles,
    showing that our example has odd parity
    (5 4 2 1)=
    (1 5 4 2)=
    (1 5)(1 4)(1 2) three 2-cycles,
                    odd parity
    
    Proof:
    (1 2 3 4 5)*(1 5)(1 4)(1 2)=
    (5 1 3 2 4) this could be good
    
    and again
    (1 2 3 4 5)*(1 5 4 2)=
    (1 2 3 4 5)*(5 4 2 1)=
    (1 2 3 4 5)*(5 4)(5 2)(5 1)=
    (5 1 3 2 4) which agrees, now
    
    An example of the Rubik group's element F
    
    F=(FUR FDR FDL FUL)(FU FR FD FL)(FC)=
      (FUR FDR)(FUR FDL)(FUR FUL)*(FU FR)(FU FD)(FU FL)
      a permutation of order 4, according to current understanding
      a permutation of even parity
    
    Proof:
    (FU FUR FR FDR FD FDL FL FUL FC)*F=
    (FU FUR FR FDR FD FDL FL FUL FC)*
     (FUR FDR)(FUR FDL)(FUR FUL)*(FU FR)(FU FD)(FU FL)=
    (FR FDR FD FDL FL FUL FU FUR FC)  which agrees, with the
                                      visual perception
    
    Algorithm A. Write the cononical cycle of a given combination
    of permutations.
    A1. [Start a cycle] Find the smallest element that has not been
        noted, write a left opening parenthesis followed by the
        starting element.
    A2. [Complete the cycle] Follow the movements of the starting
        element from step A1 until the cycle closes again with the
        starting element. Close the cycle with a right closing
        parentheses.
    A3. [Next cycle or terminate] If there are unnoted elements
        left then go to step A1.  Otherwise the algorithm
        terminates. ||
    
    Example 1. Given (1 2 4)(3 5)*(6 1 2)(3 4); we have, written
               in the two line notation for a permutation:
               (1 2 3 4 5 6)
               (6 3 5 2 4 1)
    
        A1. The smallest element is 1 and we write "(1 ".
        A2. We follow and complete the cycle "(1 6)".
        A3. There is more, so we go back to step A1.
        A1. The smallest element left is 2 and we write "(2 ".
        A2. We follow and complete "(2 3 5 4)". (Note that 4 is
            followed by 2, therefor this cycle completes with
            the 4 element.)
        A3. All done. "(1 6)(2 3 5 4)" is the result. ||
    
            The smallest common multiplier of this result's cycle
            lengths is 4, and therefor the order of this
            permutation is 4.
    
            This permutation can be written as a combination of
            four 2-cycles, namely (1 6)(2 3)(2 5)(2 4) and
            therefor the parity of this permutation is even.

    gnubik: spell out the colours and the six faces
    
    0 red       Front  F
    1 green     Back      B
    2 blue      Up     U
    3 cyan      Down      D
    4 magenta   Left   L
    5 yellow    Right     R
    
    Notes: there are 3x3x3 cubes, with
     8  corner cubes that are part of 3 faces
     12 edge cubes that are part of 2 faces
     6  centre cubes that are part of 1 face, and
     1  invisible cube at the centre of the Rubic,
        with no face.
    
    Things, here, are abstraced within the concepts of a
    non-abelian group.  The set of 12 basic elements is
     {F,f,B,b,U,u,D,d,L,l,R,r}.
    
     F clockwise 90 degree rotation of the front face
     f counter-clockwise
     B clockwise back face rotation by 90 degrees
     b count-clockwise, back face
     U up face, clockwise
     u up face, counter-clockwise
     D down face, clock
     d down face, counter-clock
     L left face, clock
     l left face, counter clock
     R right face, clock
     r right face, counter-clock
    
    Names of the 26 visible cubes' examples
     F   centre cube that is visible
         on the front face (red)
     FU  edge cube seen
         on the front and up faces (red,blue)
     FUL corner cube seen on
         front, up, and left faces (red,blue,magenta)
    
    The Rubik group's zero element: no rotation, and
    no change to the Rubik's arrangement, 0 (for now).
    
    The group's inverse element of the F transform, for
    example, being the rotation of the front face in the
    clockwise direction, is the f transform,
    counter-clockwise rotation of the front face.
    
    The group's additive operation * sequences
    two Rubik elements, and creates another composite
    element of the Rubik group's set.
    
    For example, connecting two basic elements F and U,
    creates the composite Rubik element F*U. This
    operation first rotates the front face by
    90 degrees in the clockwise direction, and then
    rotates of the up face by 90 degrees. (Note:
    order of operations matter as the group is
    non-commutative.)
    
    As another example, the composite element A=F*U
    of the Rubik group has the inverse element -A=u*f.
    Proof: A*-A=0, with 0 being the neutral element,
    since A*-A=F*U*(u*f)=0, and no change of
    theRubik's arrangement is effected.
