* Taking pictures
  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POV-Ray][POV-ray]] has an example of the box.
** [[./S_F.pov][Now, again]] we started with a single cubelet at the centre
   and filled the surrounding twelve edges, eight corners, and
   six centres. (That's what we thought we did.  However, turning
   this cube of nine cubelets reveals a hole in the centre of
   the front face.)

** [[./S_F0.pov][So, what if]] we turn this around the Y-axis
   So, after all, we have identified the wrongs; and now we can
   move on.

** [[./S_F1.pov][The front face]] is to be rotated clockwise
   Here, in our perception only, we rotate the front face.  We do
   this by rotating the nine front face cubelets. (Just another
   approach)
