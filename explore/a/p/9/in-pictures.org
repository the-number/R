* Taking pictures
  [[../../perm4.tex]] is our view on Rubik's cube.
** [[./orientation_3.pov][POV-ray]] helps to imagine things
   The current challenge is to find all possible orientations of
   the cube and its different cubelets.
   We saw how to address the different particles, the cubelets of
   the cube.  Now we want explore how to spin those cubelets.
   We estimate to find 24 such orientations. By orientation we
   mean the arrangement of the six faces of the cubelet and just
   looking at two adjacent facelets specifies such an arrangement.

   There are six faces. Each may be in the front position.
   Then there are four faces that may assume the up position, say.
   $6*4=24$ guides our estimate that there are $24$
   such orientations. $24$ ways to spin it.
   
   We have seen different ways of how to make this visible.
   Here, we use the POV-ray language to model this.
   Elsewhere, in [[../../perm4.pdf][perm4]], we have already taken different approaches
   to the same issues.

   Anyway, this is the picture that we start with.

   this is the one that tries to show our progress

  [[./orientation_4.pov.log]] should show us the errors we made
