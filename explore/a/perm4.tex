\beginsection 2. Permutations

\e
TAoCP in chapter 1.2.5 gives two methods to generate
all permutations of a given ordered set.
Quantites of permutations are considered
with relevance to computing efficiencies.

\beginsection 3. The Wide-Awake example Group

\e
We re-think\d, re-word, and re-start
with a set of attributes, elements or objects,\break
$W=\{$ woozy, vacuous, sleepy, wide-awake $\}.$
These elements are used to generate all possible
arrangements $\eta$ which are orderd $n$-tuples with
$1\le n\le4.$
For example, $\eta=($ woozy, wide-awake $)$ is a $2$-tuple.
Now the set $\R$ is the set of all permutations that jumble
such elements like $\eta.$

\e
Let $(\R,\*,0,-)$ be the group with the set $\R$, a binary
operation $\*$, a neutral elment $0$, and
for each element $\pi\in\R$ there is an inverse element
$-\pi\in\R$ such that $\pi\*-\pi=0.$

\e
For now, here, we call this group's binary operation $composition$.
Given two elements
$\pi,\eta\in\R,$ then
$\pi\*\eta\in\R$ and $\eta\*\pi\in\R.$

% \e
% in a woozy state of progress
% $\pi=(a_1 a_2 ... a_n),$ and $\eta=(b_1 b_2 ... b_n)$, then
% $\pi\*\eta\in\R$ and $\eta\*\pi\in\R.$

\eject

\beginsection 4. Creating the Woozy set

\proclaim Theorem X. An ordered set of $n$ elements
has $n!$~arrangements.

This had a little consideration.  Here, we
convey our understanding of the Permutations and
Factorials section.\f

Given a set of objects $W=\{a_1,a_2,...,a_n\}$.
$P_n$ is the set of arrangements given $n$ objects
$a_1,...,a_n$ $\in W$, such as
$\{(a_1,a_2,...a_n),(a_2,a_1,...),...\}$. For example,
with $W=\{1,2,3\}$, we have
$$P_3=\{(123),(231),(312),(132),(321),(213)\}.$$

\e
Method 1, now, moves from $n=3$ to $n=4$ as follows.
For each element in $P_{n-1}=P_3$, place element
$a_n$ in each possible vacuous position to arrive at
$P_n=P_4$, that is
$$P_4=\{(a_na_1a_2a_3),
       (a_1a_na_2a_3),
       (a_1a_2a_na_3),
       (a_1a_2a_3a_n),
       ...,
       (a_na_2a_1a_3),
       (a_2a_na_1a_3),
       (a_2a_1a_na_3),
       (a_2a_1a_3a_n)\}$$

\beginsection 5. Accounting for these Arrangements

\e
Adding up all permutations that are so generated we have
$p_n$ the number of all elements in $P_n$ % to be
%$$p_n=\sum_{k=1}^np_k.$$.

\e
And again, after some re-view, we sense a need to re-word.
$P_{nn}$ is the set of permuted $n$-tuples, and $P_n$ is
the, probably bigger, set of all the $k$-tuples with
$k\in\{1,2,..,n\}.$. In other words, $P_n$
may mean different things, or sets of things. This also
applies to quantities that could be denoted like $p_{nk},$
and $p_{nn},$ and in case of our big wide-awake bean bag,
which we sum up to $p_n;$  probably.

\e
First, we started with $p_n=\sum_{k=1}^n k!$
to be the quantity
$p_n$ that accounts for all the elements of
arrangements in set $P_n$, 
with $p_k=k!$ for $1\le k\le n$.

However, on the back of some scrap paper, we jotted down
$\{(1),(2),(3),(4)\}$ and saw that $\{(2),(3),(4)\}$ are
not included in our sum, and
$\{(12),(21),(13),(31),(14),(41),$
$(23),(32),(24),(42),(34),(43)\}$ has $10$ 2-tuples unaccounted
for, etc.)

\e
So, for now, given that $p_{nk}=n(n-1)...(n-k+1)$\f,
combined with $p_n=\sum_{k=1}^n p_{nk}$,
we count the number of arrangements of $n$ objects to be
$p_n=\sum_{k=1}^n {n!\over{(n-k)!}}$
or some such like.

\beginsection 6. Making concrete Space

\def\h#1 {$($ #1 $)$}%
\def\k#1 #2 {$($ #1, #2 $)$}%

\e
We now look  at the set $W$ that we enumerated above and
apply method 1 to arrange things.

\e
Given $W$ as above, we have\break
\i41 \h woozy ,
          \h vacuus ,
          \h sleepy ,
          \h wide-awake \j

\ee
Then, taking one step at a time and applying method 1,
given the set

\i11 \h sleepy \j\ together with another element,
wide-awake $\in W,$
and we get

\i22 \k wide-awake sleepy ,
       \k sleepy wide-awake \j.
}% this is the end, for here
{% another beginning of a local thing, here
\def\ee{\medskip}%
\def\V#1#2#3 #4.{\noindent%
     $#1_{#2#3}=\{$ #4 $\}$}%
\def\W#1#2 #3.{\noindent%
     $P_{#1#2}=\hbox{Woozy}_{#1#2}=\{$ #3 $ \}$}%
\e Let's start counting now. We have
\ee
\W21 ( sleepy ), ( wide-awake ).
\ee
\W22 ( sleepy, wide-awake ),
     ( wide-awake, sleepy )..
\e
To sum up we get

$p_2=p_{21}+p_{22},$ with

$p_{21}=2,$ the count for the set of two 1-tuples, and

$p_{22}=2,$ the count for set set of two 2-tuples that
we have created so far.

\e
Compare things with the calculations that we made earlier,

$p_{21}={2!\over(2-1)!}=2,$ and
$p_{22}={2!\over(2-2)!}=2.$ and $p_2=p_{21}+p_{22}$

$p_2=\sum_{k=1}^2{2!\over(2-k)!}$ which has two terms
and evaluates to $p_2={2\over1!}+{2\over0!}$, and it looks
better (or is this just an illusion; however, $1!=0!=1$).

\e
Let's take our result from section 5 and adjust.

\e
$p_n=\sum_{k=1}^n(n-k+1)*{n!\over(n-k+1)!}$ and since

$(n-k+1)=(n-k+1)*(n-k)*(n-k-1)*...*1$ we can simplify and have

$p_n=\sum_{k=1}^n{n!\over(n-k)!}$ which, for our state,

yields the following sum in two terms, (given that $0!=1$)

$p_2={2\over1}+{2\over1}=2+2=4,$ which agrees with our
permutations' making.

\e
And while we are here we set a solid base by calculating the
simple case for the set $P_1$ for which $p_1=1$, as we have
counted just now.

\e
$p_n=\sum_{k=1}^n{n!\over(n-k)!}$
with $n=1$ yields $p_1={1!\over(1-1)!}=1$
and confirms the basic case.

\e
So, does our formula hold its stepping up.
Assuming that $p_n=\sum_{k=1}^n{n!\over(n-k)!}$ is correct,
we need to find the terms to make $p_{n+1}$ from that.
(to be continued)
\hfil\eject

\beginsection 7. A few observations to count

\indent%
$p_{22}=p_{21}=2$

$p_{33}=p_{32}$

$p_{nk}=n(n-1)...(n-k+1)={n!\over(n-k)!}$

$1!=0!=1$ seems a reasonable cause, since
$(n-(n-1))!=1!=1$ and $(n-n)!=0!=1.$

$p_{32}=2p_{31}$ as $p_{31}=3$ and $p_{32}=6$ and it
appears that is on the same ground as the previous line
of reasoning; the nature of $x!$ being $x(x-1)...3*2*1$,
while with increasing $k$ the positive integer sequence
is a steady factor. (to be re-worded)

So, $p_{n2}=2p_{n1}$, $p_{n3}=3p_{n2}$, and $p_{n4}=4p_{n3}$,
or some such like.
(Well, probably it is not a conjecture that will
turn out to be true.)

We find four order three cycles and their respective

Maybe $chief$ is a more appropriate designation than $id$.)

{
Again, we find three 4-cycles. We reverse to form their
inverse. We follow the four permutation instances that
are specified by these
six order four canonical cycle permutations.

As an additional step, here, in order to give some
visual~clue as to the uniqueness of each 4-tuple,
we have ordered the said permutation~cyles to list
the canonical cycle~representation as the first element
of its row. (As a permutation, each element
in each of the six rows below
will permute the standard permutation, say the
4-tuple~1234, to the identical resulting arrangement.)

How significant is this?  We aim to find an understanding
of how we may abstract this in the context of group~theory.
Given the 24 permutations listed, we have only
six group elements. Each has four different representations.
For example, the group's elements $3412$ and $4123$ are
equal because the permutation $(1234)\*(3412)=(2341)$
is equal to $(1234)\*(4123)=(2341).$
