\beginsection 1. Plain \TeX nology % and some Maths

\proclaim Theorem T. All things are not necessarily the same

\beginsection 2. Permutations

\e
TAoCP in chapter 1.2.5 gives two methods to generate
all permutations of a given ordered set.
Quantites of permutations are considered
with relevance to computing efficiencies.

\beginsection 3. The Wide-Awake example Group

\e
We re-think, re-word, and re-start
with a set of attributes, elements or objects,\break
$W=\{$ woozy, vacuous, sleepy, wide-awake $\}.$
These elements are used to generate all possible
arrangements $\eta$ which are orderd $n$-tuples with
$1\le n\le4.$
For example, $\eta=($ woozy, wide-awake $)$ is a $2$-tuple.
Now the set $\R$ is the set of all permutations that jumble
such elements like $\eta.$

\e
Let $(\R,\*,0,-)$ be the group with the set $\R$, a binary
operation $\*$, a neutral elment $0$, and
for each element $\pi\in\R$ there is an inverse element
$-\pi\in\R$ such that $\pi\*-\pi=0.$

\e
For now, here, we call this group's binary operation $composition$.
Given two elements
$\pi,\eta\in\R,$ then
$\pi\*\eta\in\R$ and $\eta\*\pi\in\R.$

% \e
% in a woozy state of progress
% $\pi=(a_1 a_2 ... a_n),$ and $\eta=(b_1 b_2 ... b_n)$, then
% $\pi\*\eta\in\R$ and $\eta\*\pi\in\R.$

\beginsection 4. Creating the Woozy set

\proclaim Theorem X. An ordered set of $n$ elements
has $n!$~arrangements.

This has been give a little consideration.  Here, we
convey our current understanding of the Permutations and
Factorials section.\f

Given a set of objects $W=\{a_1,a_2,...,a_n\}$.
$P_n$ is the set of arrangements given $n$ objects
$a_1,...,a_n$ $\in W$, such as
$\{(a_1,a_2,...a_n),(a_2,a_1,...),...\}$. For example,
with $W=\{1,2,3\}$, we have
$$P_3=\{(123),(231),(312),(132),(321),(213)\}.$$

\e
Method 1, now, moves from $n=3$ to $n=4$ as follows.
For each element in $P_{n-1}=P_3$, place element
$a_n$ in each possible vacuous position to arrive at
$P_n=P_4$, that is
$$P_4=\{(a_na_1a_2a_3),
       (a_1a_na_2a_3),
       (a_1a_2a_na_3),
       (a_1a_2a_3a_n),
       ...,
       (a_na_2a_1a_3),
       (a_2a_na_1a_3),
       (a_2a_1a_na_3),
       (a_2a_1a_3a_n)\}$$

\e
Adding up all permutations that are so generated we have
$p_n$ the number of all elements in $P_n$ to be
$$p_n=\sum_{k=1}^np_k.$$
With $p_k=k!$ for $1\le k\le n$ this equates to
$$p_n=\sum_{k=1}^n k!$$.
(To be reconsidered! We assume this to be incorrect. Either
keep on reading TAoCP 1.2.5, or consider that with $n=4$ there
are now $4-1$ additional 1-tuples, $4-2$ other 2-tuples,
and $4-3$ more 3-tuples.)
